Shynav.js
=========

Shynav Plugin. This is a little plugin that hides/shows the nav based on scrolling. It's decoupled from the styles, so you are left to implement whatever styles meet the needs of a nav when scrolled, detached from the top, and hidden - by [Matt Shwery](https://github.com/mshwery)

### Usage
```
$('#header').shynav({
  delay: 4000,
  minScroll: 0,
  detachedClass: 'fixed'
});
```
